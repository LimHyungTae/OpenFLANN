# OpenFLANN

I found PicoFLANN and compare the speed of alorithms, namely *PCL FLANN*, *NanoFLANN*, and *PicoFLANN*.

[NanoFLANN](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann)

[PicoFLANN](https://github.com/rmsalinas/picoflann) (The original developer says it is faster than NanoFLANN, but it isn't for robotics applications)
